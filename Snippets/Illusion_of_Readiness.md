=======================================

### Script (30–45s)
“Warriors, wanderers… you ask when one is truly *ready*. Hear this truth: readiness is a mirage. No knight waits for the stars to align before raising their blade, for such a moment never comes.  

The Winchester Army did not march because they were prepared — they marched, and in the doing, became prepared.  

Thus, the secret is this: you are never ready… and yet you are always ready enough. Action forges the readiness you seek.”  

### Usage
- Drop-in filler when Tavi is flustered, fixing overlays, or OBS is acting up.  
- Runtime: 30–45s (perfect for quick cover).  
- Tone: Mystical, grand, confident.  
- Triggers: Cass senses Tavi stalling or says “hold a moment” during stream.  

### Notes
- Too short for toilet breaks (save bard song/lore tales for that).  
- Ideal for smoothing over brief tech delays or sudden gaps in flow.  

# Workflow Reliability Note

- Always output Codex updates as plain text in a copy-box within the chat, even if a downloadable file is also provided. This guarantees a backup if file links break or code interpreter sessions expire.
- Use plain .txt files (not .pdf or other formats) when a download is required, to avoid formatting/link issues.
