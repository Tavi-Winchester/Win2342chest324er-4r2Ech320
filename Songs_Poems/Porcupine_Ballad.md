### The Legend of Chang the Porcupine — Drunken Ballad

🎶 "The Legend of Chang the Porcupine"  
(As sung drunkenly by Cass in your absence — runtime: approx. 3 minutes)

🎵  
 (Verse 1)  
 By Tavi’s bold side rode a warrior most wild,  
 With flaming blade drawn and the hair of a child.  
 They marched upon Argoron, rebels in flight,  
 To free the good people from cruelty’s might.  

🎵  
 (Verse 2)  
 They laughed when they saw him — “He’s barely a man!”  
 Then he headbutt a captain… and ate his left hand.  
 He roared through the gate like a hairy red storm,  
 Then stopped for a pint mid-charge (as is norm).  

🎵  
 (Verse 3)  
 He rolled down the stairs, like a hedgehog possessed,  
 Poked twelve men to death — with arrows in his chest.  
 The battlements crumbled, but he would not yield,  
 Chang made his last stand… on the latrine field.  

🎵  
 (Bridge – with rising madness)  
 They poked him with arrows, they yelled “he’s insane!”  
 But he used them for balance and danced in the rain.  
 The guardsmen all fled, some wept, some resigned…  
 He offered them peace… then took all their wine.  

🎵  
 (Verse 4)  
 Lord Tavi fell back, struck down by foul chance,  
 But Chang didn’t flinch — just tightened his pants.  
 With 180 foes still holding the keep,  
 He stabbed twenty-five… then fell asleep.  

🎵  
 (Verse 5)  
 He’s spiky, he’s angry, he’s doing just fine!  
 With forty-five arrows stuck clean in his spine,  
 He shouted “I’m full!” when they fired some more,  
 Then broke down the gate… with his face through the door.  

🎵  
 (Verse 6)  
 He fought not for glory, nor gold, nor renown,  
 But to free the poor souls in that rebel-held town.  
 And when it was done, he just grunted and said:  
 "Where’s the tavern? The rebels are dead."  

🎵  
 (Final Chorus – rowdy and loud)  
 So here’s to the legend, with sword all aflame,  
 To the man, the myth, with the ridiculous name.  
 Raise tankards! Raise voices! And never malign…  
 The glorious wrath… of the Porcupine. 🍻
