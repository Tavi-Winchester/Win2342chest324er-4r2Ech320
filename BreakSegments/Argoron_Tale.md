### The Fall of Argoron – The Rise of Chang the Porcupine

"Come closer, wanderers, and listen well. For this is not merely a tale of war, but of destiny, desperation, and the day a man became a legend."

The proud city of Argoron lay in chains, seized by a rebel host cruel and merciless. Its people cried out for salvation, their pleas reaching the ears of Tavi Winchester, the conquering knight, and his loyal Clan. With banners raised, he answered their call, marching to free the city from tyranny.

But the defenders were many, their numbers a tide against the few. Still, the Winchester host fought valiantly, each blow ringing with defiance.

Yet fate is a cruel mistress. Branch, steadfast companion, was the first to fall, then came Sledge, Papa, Klepto, and the rest, one by one swallowed by the press of steel. Soon after, even Tavi himself was struck down—not by cowardice, but by the cruel twist of chance in the chaos of battle.

All seemed lost. The rebel army jeered, their victory assured.

And then—there was Chang.

Chang, champion of the people. Loyal viewer. Warrior of improbable might and determination. He refused to let Tavi or the people of Argoron down.

One man stood against one hundred and eighty. The odds were laughable. The enemy mocked him, thinking him doomed. Arrows darkened the sky, yet he did not falter. He fought with desperate courage, every wound matched by another foe cast down. And as he fought, the gods—or perhaps the spirits of Twitch chat—whispered healing into his veins.

The Castle walls were paved with the fallen, until none stood against him. Argoron bowed not to an army, but to one stubborn soul who refused to fall or give up when people needed him.

Blow after blow, slash after slash, the tide turned. With each desperate recovery, more foes fell. The siege became a slaughter—their slaughter.

When the dust settled, Argoron’s streets ran red with the blood of rebels. One hundred and eighty foes lay broken, and the people who had prayed for salvation beheld their deliverance. The gates of the city opened not to a conquering army, but to a single warrior who refused to die.

But Chang… oh, poor Chang. His body was pierced with so many arrows, he bristled like a beast of the wild. And so, he was reborn—not as man, but as legend.

Chang the Porcupine.  
First of his name. Savior of Argoron. Bane of rebels. Thorn in the side of empires.

And so it is said: Never mock the odds when Clan Winchester rides… for even one porcupine may topple a kingdom.
