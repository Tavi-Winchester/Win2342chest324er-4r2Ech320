### Letter from the Front – PapaJymbo

Dear Mum,  
I joined the Winchester Army for the promise of glory, purpose, and a dental plan. So far, I’ve been trampled by a cow, set on fire by a friendly flaming sword, and promoted to “Chief Stick Holder” after Bigger Branch got stuck in a fence.

Sassy told me that was a prestigious title. Sassy also once tried to charge a catapult on foot, so I remain skeptical.

Last night, Klepto Unicorn stole our commander’s tent while he was still in it, and Spartan challenged a tree to single combat. He lost.

Morale is... confusing. Chang says he’s proud of us, but he’s been bleeding since last Tuesday and no one’s sure if he sleeps or just waits.

If you see Sledge the Ledge, tell him to stop licking the torches. Or at least to explain why we call him that.

Yours questionably,  
— Private PapaJymbo
