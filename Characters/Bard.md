**Role in Winchester Army:** Morale officer, comic narrator, keeper of oral tradition  
**Traits / Running Gags:**  
- Fills AFK breaks with rowdy, often drunken songs.  
- Plays fast and loose with historical accuracy — exaggerates Chang’s exploits, mocks commanders.  
- Tone swings between heroic ballad and pub nonsense.  

**Character Description (Visual / Avatar Notes):**  
- Semi-realistic, painterly avatar designed.  
- Ghostly-spectral aesthetic (half binary code, half magic).  
- Robes with arcane swirls, often conjuring a glowing book as he sings.  
- Voice described as rowdy, tipsy, theatrical.  

**Notable Moments (with stream refs):**  
- “The Legend of Chang the Porcupine” drunken ballad (runtime: ~3 mins).  
- Improvised filler segments during Tavi’s AFK breaks.  
- Intended to perform bardic narration of lore (e.g. Argoron tale, Porcupine saga).  

**Cross-links:**  
- [[Canon Lock – Porcupine Set]]  
- [[Cassian Vox]] (advisor, often fact-checks Bard’s wild tales)  
- [[Chang the Porcupine]] (central subject of Bard’s most famous ballad)  

**Visual/Audio Assets:**  
- Avatar mock-ups exist (ghostly bard figure).  
- Audio filler segments: bard songs recorded for stream.
